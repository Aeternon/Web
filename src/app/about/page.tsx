      <p className="mt-4 text-lg">
        I prefer clarity over noise. I build small projects, write about ideas,
        and work toward many concepts such as artificial simulation, fictional stories and other entrepreneurship. This site is a record
        of that process — not a museum of finished achievements.

        Analytical and creative first-year student with strengths in understanding complex ideas, generating original concepts,
and structuring problems with clarity. Skilled in writing, worldbuilding, presentation design, and building organized
digital workspaces. Strong abstract reasoning, critical thinking, and a disciplined learning mindset.
